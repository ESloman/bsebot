**`bsebot`** is a Discord bot that provides a user economy and betting system for a server. Users again `eddies` (points), each day and can also create bets to spend their eddies on. The user with the highest amount of eddies is the **`KING`** of the server - the King gets a special role and earns taxes on other users' earnings.

Bot was originally created for the `BSE` server to fulfill a need to have something similar to _twitch predictions_ for placing bets on the server's games of Valorant. The bot has become a bit more generic and has other functions that are specific for the `BSE` server.

**NOTE**: The aim is to make the code more server agnostic so that it can invited to other servers. Will add an invite link here once that's been completed. Issue #79 captures that work.
